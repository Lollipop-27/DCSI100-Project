    "The exact definition for a music genre is sometimes difficult to judge, and people tend to classify songs based on 'feel' and loose characteristics. What if there was a more concrete and systematic way to complete this classification? This project aims to produce a model that can, given a song's numeric characteristics, predict its genre. We are using an open-source dataset on Kaggle which contains information on various song characteristics such as duration, dancability, popularity, and acousticness. The dataset was last updated in December of 2021.\n",
